#AndroidListenerExamples
=======================
A repository for examples for my talks at the [AndroidListener](http://twitter.com/AndroidListener) meetup in Chicago. 

Examples are backwards-compatible to API 10 (aka 2.3.3 Gingerbread) except as noted. 


###FullscreenVideoWebviewFragment

From the September 2013 talk "Why is this so hard?!: Playing Full-Screen YouTube Videos From An Internal WebView", an example of how to play video full-screen from an embedded __WebView__. Uses the __MainActivity__ to handle swapping out the content view.
